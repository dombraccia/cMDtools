# cMDtools

Check out the cMDeda folder above for visualizations I made of the curated
datasets provided by the curatedMetagenomicTeam! I hope this helps you 
narrow down data sources for your bioinformatics projects. 

Let please let me know if you have any questions about my figures or if there
are any other datasets you are interested in vizualizing!
